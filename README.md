## Course Description

Applications rarely are comprised of a tangled set of static files. They're dynamic. They update. They remember things. The course will introduce the concepts of a database and Web applications as a set of design problems. The class will investigate server-side applications, third-party data sources and APIs and how applications can become dynamic and highly functional. To approach the design and construction of applications that derive from datasources and databases, this course builds upon an essential knowledge of Web Standards, user interface design, and usability to support the creation of functional and responsive projects for the Web across multiple devices and platforms. Students will incorporate interaction design, visual design, user experience and code to rapidly sculpt data into content. By the end of the course, students should be able to design, build and deploy data-driven Web applications. The course employs a pedagogy suitable for designers, artists and technologists who seek an empowerment achieved by being able to build data-driven applications. We will learn JavaScript properly. Then, we will learn useful design patterns. Then we will pick up useful tools for making cool things better.

## Learning Outcomes

By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Have a better understanding of how web applications work
* Be comfortable with coding in JavaScript, from server to front-end.
* Develop working prototypes and publish them.
* Select and apply different technologies in order to realize their ideas.

## Assessable Tasks

All assignments must be submitted through your personal Github repo. I will add each student as a submodule to our [student's homework repository](https://github.com/umisyam/WebAdvJS_Fall2016_StudentsHW) so that it's easier to check everyone's homework.

### Weekly Assignments

Please refer to each week's readme file for the list of weekly assignment.


#### Midterm

Build a data-driven web application. Your project must:

* At least read data from an external source — could be from a JSON file, from a database, or whatever you feel more comfortable with.
* Have no less than 2 different "screens." If it's a dynamic html website, have at least 2 pages within the same url, but just different “#”/hash page. If you're building a canvas-based game, maybe you have 2 scenes? If it's a datavis, 2 charts or 2 ways of visualizing the same data and so on.
* Respond to user interaction.

#### Final Project

Build an interactive web app that meets these requirements:

* Interacts with the server-side using NodeJS
* Includes bi-directional communication using websockets, any of these are valid:  client <--> server, hardware <--> server communication. We're looking for true communication, sending and receiving data/messages/actions/inputs back and forth.
* Outputs a visualization on the front-end side using either P5.js, D3.js, or Three.js.

Using database is optional in this case. If you want to make it more interesting, feel free to explore the possibility of connecting microcontrollers hardware as input/output. Send me a proposal of your final project first.


## Required Tools

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* Terminal (Mac) / Command Prompt (PC)
* A [Github account](https://github.com/) and a way to access it. Feel free to either Terminal or a desktop app — [Github for Mac](https://desktop.github.com/), [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or whatever you feel comfortable with.
