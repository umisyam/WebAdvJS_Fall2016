#### Midterm

Build a data-driven web application. Your project must:

* At least read data from an external source — could be from a JSON file, from a database, or whatever you feel more comfortable with.
* Have no less than 2 different "screens." If it's a dynamic html website, have at least 2 pages within the same url, but just different “#”/hash page. If you're building a canvas-based game, maybe you have 2 scenes? If it's a datavis, 2 charts or 2 ways of visualizing the same data and so on.
* Respond to user interaction.
