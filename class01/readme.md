### Homework Week 1

Demonstrate your comfort level in Javascript. Choose one theme below to implement:

* **Calculator** - can be anything from simple numeric calculator, a tip calculator, to the quirky ones like Love calculator, Friendship calculator, etc.
* **A Trivia/Quiz App** with at least 5 questions (inputs can be multiple-choice, sliders, text-box, anything you want). Think: Buzzfeed-style, or make it even better!

Requirement: must have a visual interface, not just console.log() on Terminal

Submission: upload to your own Github repo and send the link of your repo to umi@newschool.edu before the next class starts.
