### Homework Week 4

1. Find an old web project that you've done so far that's not yet designed to be responsive. For example: Your Bootcamp web final, your own portfolio site, any of the homework week 1-3, any of your old Major Studio project, a personal project, or even a Thesis-1 prototype.
2. Make them responsive for mobile
3. **Take 4 screenshots of at least 2 different pages on both desktop and mobile**. For example, on the home page and Work/Gallery/About page.
4. Upload both your code and screenshots in your own Github repo.

**Bonus: **

Make them responsive for tablet too! Thus, take **6** screenshots of at least 2 different pages on desktop, mobile, and tablet.
